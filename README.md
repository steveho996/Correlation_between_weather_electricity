# Report website for correlation between weather and electricty price

This case study demonstrates how I build end-to-end report website with real Finland electricity data using Python and Power Query, following a clear ETL flow and load all project to Github via Vs code.

## ETL Flow

### 1. Extract
- Source: CSV files exported from logistics operations database
- Files loaded into **Power Query** to inspect data structure, types, and quality

### 2. Transform
- Data cleaned and standardized using **Power Query**:

### 3. Load
- Cleaned CSV files loaded into **PostgreSQL**
- Build correlation visualisation between weather and electricity price
- Analyst the correlation
- Publish on website via streamline
